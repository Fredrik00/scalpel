# Scalpel
>*A clean cut in medical organizing*
## About
This application is made to complement the desktop program that doctors, nurses and coordinators at hospitals in Norway use to plan surgeries. It will mainly be used on a smart phone and is therefore developed with a mobile-first focus. It is developed by a team of students at NTNU for the course TDT4290.
## Dependencies
- React
- d3.js

## Starting the app
- First install dependencies using `npm install`
- Then the development server can be started using `npm start`

## Development guidelines
- When starting on a new issue, create a new branch and call it something descriptive. Also add a link to the branch on the trello issue.
- Commit often, use descriptive commit messages.
- Merge master into your branch often, so there won't be large conflicts.
- If you need to make a small change outside the component you are working on, make the change in the master branch, notify the team, and merge master into your branch.
- When you move the issue to QA on trello, create a pull request and link to it on trello.
