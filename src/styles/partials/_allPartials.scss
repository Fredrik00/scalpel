/*

### BASE FILE - Imports all files in the partials folder ###

In the folder we might want to add _buttons.scss, _grids.scss etc.
They should in general be added in this file.

This file can then be included to import all partials,
instead of having to import all individual files.

Partials vs Shared: Partials are element specific, while shared is
more Scalpel specifc.
